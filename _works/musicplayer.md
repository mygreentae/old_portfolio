title: Music Player
description: This is the first collaborative project I worked on where I really solidified my understanding of git (or having some kind of version control). As a team, we ended up creating something that I think is really cool and had a really fun experience out of it. This was written in Java, used JavaFX for the GUI, and utilized the MVC architecture.
