tile: My Portfolio Website
description: I think I'll have to add my portfolio to the list of my works too! I made the website using Jekyll from scratch. Through making this website, I was able to solidify my understanding of Jekyll practice my HTML and CSS skills. After a few more tweaks, I hope to make this a custom theme open for the public to use too!
