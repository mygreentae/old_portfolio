description: I think I'll have to add my portfolio to the list of my works too! I made the website using Jekyll from scratch--with the credits for the landing page <a href="https://github.com/longpdo/neumorphism">icons</a> and credits for <a href="https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/">particles.js</a>. Through making this website, I was able to solidify my understanding of Jekyll practice my HTML and CSS skills. After a few more tweaks, I hope to make this a custom theme open for the public to use too!
