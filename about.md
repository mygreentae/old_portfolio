# **About Me**

## Who am I?

Hello there! I am Leighanna. I'm from Phoenix, Arizona. I just graduated with my M.S. in Human Langauge Technology (May 2024). I also graduated in May 2023 with my B.S. in Computer Science and my B.A. in East Asian Studies with a Chinese Langauge Emphasis with a minor in Linguistics. 

I started programming in my freshman year of university out of interest in computer science. This class immediately captured my continual interest which lead me to where I am today with as a developer, engineer, researcher, computational linguist, or whatever you would like to call me by because I don't really know myself.

I have done various internships in the field regarding computational linguistics specifically in natural langauge processing. So, I have done quite a bit of work with applied machine learning, as well as having dabbled in research in this field under a couple of professors during my time as a student.

Outside of working, I tend to be crafty so I like to crochet or study new languages (my long time interest and study has been Japanese). And I also enjoy walking dogs at the local shelter when I have time.
