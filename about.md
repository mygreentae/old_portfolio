# **About Me**

## Who am I?

I am Leighanna. I'm from Phoenix, Arizona. I am currently working towards my Master's degree in Human Language Technology which I am expected to graduate with this May (2024). I also graduated in 2023 with a B.S. in  Computer Science and a B.A. in Chinese Language with a minor in Linguistics. I started out with a great interest with Linguistics and how languages work. Later, I discovered programming in my first computer science course I took freshman year of university. Since then, I have had passionate about programming and computer science. So, I have a great interest in the interection of linguitics and computer science.

I started off learning Python 3, then later learned some Java and C in my programming classes. Then, I picked up HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP later from a WebDev class I took and was able to build off of those skills to learn how to use Jekyll -- which is what this website is built on. I have most experience in Python (my language of choice) since I am most comfortable in using it, but I tend pick up programming langauges and technologies fairly quickly. I was also able to learn various other langauges such as Haskell, Perl, R, Prolog, etc.

When not programming, I tend to be crafty so I like to crochet. And I also enjoy walking dogs at the local shelter.
